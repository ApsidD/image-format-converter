## üîß Troubleshooting

### Actions Not Running?
- Make sure the repository is public or you have GitHub Actions enabled
- Check the "Actions" tab for any errors
- Verify the workflow file exists at `.github/workflows/release.yml`

### Build Failing?
- Check the Actions logs for specific errors
- Most common issue: dependencies not installing correctly
- macOS builds sometimes fail on first try - just re-run them
